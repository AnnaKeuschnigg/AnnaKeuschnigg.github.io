        <h1>Lake Rotoiti</h1>
        <p>Lake Rotoiti is a lake in the <strong>Bay of Plenty</strong> region of New Zealand. It is the
            northwesternmost in a chain of lakes formed within the Okataina caldera. The lake is close to the northern
            shore of its more famous neighbour, Lake Rotorua, and is connected to it via the Ohau Channel. It drains to
            the Kaituna River, which flows into the Bay of Plenty near Maketu. <br>

            The full name of the lake is <em>Te Rotoiti-kite-a-Īhenga</em>, which in the Māori language means "The Small
            Lake Discovered By Īhenga", the Māori explorer also credited with discovering Lake Rotorua. Legend says that
            the lake was named as such because when Ihenga first saw it, he was only able to see a small part of it and
            thought the lake was a lot smaller.

        <p>Since the 1960s, the quality of lake water has been negatively affected by inflows of nitrogen rich water
            from Lake Rotorua, agricultural run-off from surrounding farms and seepage from domestic septic tanks. The
            effects of this included an almost permanent algal bloom in the Okere arm of the lake and choking lake weed
            growth in other still areas of the lake. A barrier to divert the nutrient rich waters of Lake Rotorua into
            the Kaituna River was completed in late 2008. <br>

            The Bay of Plenty Regional Council expected to see improvement in lake water quality within five years and
            the Rotorua Te Arawa Lakes Program reported in 2013 that the intervention has significantly improved water
            quality. Water quality is the highest it has been in decades, on track to meet targets set by the Program to
            meet community expectations.

            Lake Rotoiti has thermal hot-spring baths on the southern shore which are accessible by boat.<br>(Quelle: <a
